They choose those ones who do not have many  relatives, they assasinate them and then sell their organs to very rich  clients, at very high prices.<br /> <br /> These employees are registered in the secret files of the company as "special clients"!<br /> <br /> One of our agents has been hired as by the particular company. Unfortunately, since 01/01/2007 he has gone missing.<br /> <br /> We know that our agent is alive, but we cannot contact him. Last time he  communicated with us, he mentioned that we could contact him at the  e-mail address the company has supplied him with, should there a problem  arise.<br /> <br /> The problem is that when we last talked to him, he had not a company  e-mail address yet, but he told us that his e-mail can be found through  the company's site.<br /> <br /> The only thing we remember is that he was hired on Friday the 13th!<br /> <br /> You have to find his e-mail address and send it to us by using the central communication panel of the company's site.<br /> <br /> Good luck!!!</p>

Unfortunately, her grades are not that  good. You are now thinking "This is big news!"... Hmmm, maybe not. What  is big news, however, is this: The network administrator asked for  3,000 euros to change her marks into A's. This is obviously a case of  administrative authority abuse. Hence... a good chance for D-phase and  public exposure...</p>
<p><br /> I need to get into the site as admin and upload an index.htm  file in the web-root directory, that will present all required evidence  for the University's latest "re-marking" practices!<br /> I only need you to find the admin password for me...<br /> <br /> Good Luck!</p>
